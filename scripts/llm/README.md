# LLM Chat Cli

This project uses various tools to execute a command-line interface (CLI) program. It leverages `Jbang` to run Java code without needing to set up a full Java project. Additionally, `picocli` is used for building the CLI, and `langchain4j` is used for working with language models. Finally, `gemini` is used for data processing.

## Tools Used

- **[JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/)**: A tool for running Java scripts without needing to build a full Java project.
- **[Picocli](https://picocli.info/)**: A library for creating command-line interfaces (CLI) in Java.
- **[Langchain4j](https://github.com/hub4j/langchain4j)**: A Java library for working with language models similar to LangChain.
- **[Gemini](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/integrations/language-models/google-ai-gemini)**: A LLM Model from google.

## Installing JBang

To use JBang, you need to install it first. Please follow the instructions at the following link:

[Install JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/download/)

## Running the Code with JBang

Once JBang is installed, you can run your Java code directly with the following command:

```bash
jbang LlmCli.java
```

This command allows you to execute your code without needing to create a full Java project.

## Creating a Native Image with GraalVM

To create a native executable (native image) using GraalVM, first, you need to export the JAR file. Use the following command to export it:

```bash
jbang export portable LlmCli.java
```

This command generates the JAR file with the necessary dependencies.

### Building the Executable with GraalVM

Once the JAR file is generated, you can build the native executable (exe) using the following command:

```bash
native-image -cp .\lib\picocli-4.6.3.jar  -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflect-config.json -jar .\LlmCli.jar aicli
```

This will generate a native executable that you can run directly on your system.

### Running the Executable

Once you have built the `aicli.exe` executable, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
aicli.exe -p "Tell me a dad joke."
```

This will execute the program and provide a response based on the prompt provided.

```bash
# Example output:
"Why don't scientists trust atoms? 

Because they make up everything!"
```

This is how you can interact with the executable in the command line.

### Adding the Executable to Your PATH

To make it easier to run `aicli.exe` from any location in the terminal, you can add it to your systemâ€™s PATH environment variable.

#### On Windows

1. Place the `aicli.exe` file in a folder (e.g., `C:\tools\aicli`).
2. Open **Control Panel** and navigate to **System and Security** > **System** > **Advanced System Settings**.
3. Click on **Environment Variables**.
4. Under **System variables**, find the **Path** variable, select it, and click **Edit**.
5. In the **Edit Environment Variable** window, click **New** and add the path to the folder where `aicli.exe` is located (e.g., `C:\tools\aicli`).
6. Click **OK** to save the changes.
7. Open a new terminal window, and now you can run `aicli.exe` from anywhere by simply typing:

```bash
aicli.exe -p "Tell me a dad joke."
```

By adding it to the PATH, you can easily execute the program from any directory in the terminal without needing to specify the full path to the executable.

This is how you can set up the executable for easier access from any terminal window.
